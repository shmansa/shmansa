### Hi! Welcome to Manasa Sollapura Halappa's GitHub profile.

This profile is linked to my work as a student in CSCI 630 at CSU Chico.

### Highlights

- Contributed to the frontend linter setup (PR: https://github.com/ChicoState/PantryNode/pull/134, commit: https://github.com/ChicoState/PantryNode/pull/134/commits/06a919306949b75e2b7fd4b08aa72cea1a01d47b), where my responsibilities included adding ESLint for the React frontend. This contribution ensured that the project's code has a consistent code style and helped enhance code quality and maintainability while preventing errors.
- Investigated and logged a bug in the Feed.test.tsx test file (Issue: https://github.com/ChicoState/PantryNode/issues/241). This highlight the unreliability of the Feed.test.tsx test file since the existing test cases were failing and not accurately assessing the expected behavior of the Feed component frontend.
- Added test cases for Feed page(PR: https://github.com/ChicoState/PantryNode/pull/243, commit: https://github.com/ChicoState/PantryNode/commit/8d84e6c44997ab4fd4c2a24aa3934f4dcde5884e), I fixed the failing test cases in the Feed.test.tsx file, making it accurate and reliable in assessing the expected behavior of the Feed component frontend.
- Moved .eslintrc.cjs from root to backend directory and resolved merge conflicts(PR: https://github.com/ChicoState/PantryNode/pull/140, commit: https://github.com/ChicoState/PantryNode/pull/134/commits/4ab57c4be4fa67e2a044ef7705feeac0d0f5d490) this resolved the plugin issues.
- Reviewed the code in Pull requests on Form Validation on Login-Register View (https://github.com/ChicoState/PantryNode/pull/93), Expired and expiring item count on Expiry page (https://github.com/ChicoState/PantryNode/pull/252), testing expiry page (https://github.com/ChicoState/PantryNode/pull/248), and testing Feed component (https://github.com/ChicoState/PantryNode/pull/229), I was responsible for checking the code quality, bug identification and manual testing of features.

### Timeline

- Sprint #1 - Started Feb 27th, 2023
  - Dedicated a significant amount of time to studying React and typescript tutorials since it was my first experience working with it.
  - Involved in discussion to update UI dependencies(https://github.com/ChicoState/PantryNode/issues/24). The discussion let to closing the issue with decision to replace Bootstrap for Tailwind CSS and to not include Chico State branding while migrating to React.

- Sprint #2 - Started Mar 21st, 2023

  - I spent time familiarizing myself with the codebase of Pantry Node. This involved analysing the existing code to understand its structure, functionality, and overall architecture.
  - As the issue for updating UI dependencies, was closed in 1st sprint, I collaborated with the frontend team to gain insights on how to get started. Additionally, I was involved in research and discussions related to design of frontent and task distribution among teammates. 
  

- Sprint #3 - Started April 4th, 2023
  - Pull request for Frontend Linter (https://github.com/ChicoState/PantryNode/pull/134)
  - Commit for adding ESLint for react frontend (https://github.com/ChicoState/PantryNode/pull/134/commits/06a919306949b75e2b7fd4b08aa72cea1a01d47b)
  - Commit to resolve merge conflicts and Removing ESLint from root directory as there were plugin issues(https://github.com/ChicoState/PantryNode/pull/134/commits/4ab57c4be4fa67e2a044ef7705feeac0d0f5d490)
  - Code Review for form validation on Login-Register view (https://github.com/ChicoState/PantryNode/pull/93)
  - Involved in the discussion on to create documentation of dependencies for frontend and updating Readme.md (https://github.com/ChicoState/PantryNode/issues/67)

- Sprint #4 - Started April 25th, 2023
 
  - Involved in the discussion on implementation of the expiry page frontend (https://github.com/ChicoState/PantryNode/issues/143). My assigned task was to develop a feature that would distinguish expiring, expired and safe items based on a color code, Red - Expired Products, Yellow - About to Expire Products i.e. in a week and Green - For Safe (Expiry Date > 1 week). However, due to data inconsistencies, the task was not completed as planned.
  - Commit for adding Dummy Data (https://github.com/ChicoState/PantryNode/commit/805d05ac88cace8a78f59ceab5eca03527337521), the data was failing to reflect as expected and hence could not be merged into main.
  
- Sprint #5 - Started May 9th, 2023

  - Bug Logging for failing feed component tests (https://github.com/ChicoState/PantryNode/issues/241)
  - Pull Request to fix the bug in feed component test (https://github.com/ChicoState/PantryNode/pull/243)
  - Commit to fix the logged bug (https://github.com/ChicoState/PantryNode/commit/a7d318e4a2751d3ceb857efaaef598c8e40b5992)
  - Commit to test feed component frontend (https://github.com/ChicoState/PantryNode/commit/8d84e6c44997ab4fd4c2a24aa3934f4dcde5884e)
  - Code Review for displaying the quantities of the expired and near expired items on expiry page (https://github.com/ChicoState/PantryNode/pull/252)

  - Code Review for testing expriy Table in Expiry page - https://github.com/ChicoState/PantryNode/pull/248)
  - Code Review for testing Feed component frontend (https://github.com/ChicoState/PantryNode/pull/229)
